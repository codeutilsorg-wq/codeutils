            </ul>

            <p><em>Pro tip: Paste your Base64 string and immediately click Decode to quickly verify what data it contains without needing external tools.</em></p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

            <p><strong>Encoding API Credentials for Basic Authentication</strong></p>
            <p>Many APIs use HTTP Basic Authentication which requires credentials in "username:password" format encoded to Base64. For example, if you have credentials "admin:secret123", encoding them with this tool creates the Base64 string "YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0MTIz" which you then use in the Authorization header. This ensures credentials are obfuscated in transit (though not encrypted—always use HTTPS). This tool makes creating and verifying these credentials straightforward without needing command-line tools or complex scripting.</p>

            <p><strong>Embedding Images in HTML and CSS (Data URLs)</strong></p>
            <p>Instead of linking to external image files, you can embed images directly in HTML or CSS using data URLs. First encode your image file to Base64 (using a binary file converter), then use it in code like: &lt;img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."&gt;. This reduces HTTP requests and prevents broken image links. Developers use this technique for icons, favicons, and small images embedded in web pages or email templates.</p>

            <p><strong>Decoding JWT Tokens for Debugging</strong></p>
            <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) consist of three Base64-encoded parts separated by dots (header.payload.signature). To inspect token contents without validation, you can decode each part using this tool. This helps verify claims, expiration dates, and user information contained in authentication tokens. It's essential for debugging authentication issues and understanding token structure during API development.</p>

            <p><strong>Transmitting Binary Data in JSON and XML</strong></p>
            <p>JSON and XML are text-based formats that can't directly contain binary data like images, files, or cryptographic keys. Developers encode this binary data to Base64 before including it in JSON or XML documents, then decode it on the receiving end. This is commonly used when storing files in databases, transmitting files through APIs, or including binary content in configuration files.</p>

            <h3>Tips & Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always verify URLs in emails:</strong> Phishing emails often use Base64-encoded malicious URLs to hide them from filters. Decode suspicious links with this tool before clicking</li>
                <li><strong>Base64 is encoding, not encryption:</strong> Base64 is easily reversible and should never be used for security-sensitive data. Always combine with HTTPS and proper encryption for sensitive information</li>
                <li><strong>UTF-8 characters work seamlessly:</strong> This tool handles international characters, emoji, and special symbols correctly thanks to UTF-8 encoding</li>
                <li><strong>Data size increases by ~33%:</strong> Encoded Base64 is larger than the original data, so consider this when calculating bandwidth and storage requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Use Base64URL for URLs and filenames:</strong> Standard Base64 contains characters like '+' and '/' that have special meaning in URLs. For URL-safe encoding, look for Base64URL variants</li>
                <li><strong>Test before production use:</strong> Always decode your Base64 output to verify it matches the original data before using it in production systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: Is my data safe when using this tool?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes, absolutely! All Base64 encoding and decoding happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript. Your data never leaves your computer and is never uploaded to any server. We don't store, log, or transmit your data in any way. This makes our tool completely safe for sensitive information like API credentials, authentication tokens, or proprietary data. You can even use this tool offline after the initial page load.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is Base64 encoding and why is it used?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into a readable ASCII string format using 64 printable characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /). It's used when you need to transmit binary data over text-based protocols like HTTP, email, or JSON. Base64 increases data size by approximately 33% but ensures that binary information can be safely transmitted without corruption through systems that only handle text. It's fundamental to modern web development and APIs.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I encode binary files like images with this tool?</strong></p>
            <p>A: This tool primarily handles text-based encoding. For binary files like images, you need tools that can read file bytes directly. However, this tool works perfectly for encoding text representations of data or for decoding Base64-encoded files that have already been converted to text strings. Many APIs return Base64-encoded images as text strings in JSON responses, which you can decode using this tool. For true file encoding, consider using command-line tools like `base64` command or specialized online file converters.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do I need to create an account or sign up?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No! All our tools are completely free and don't require any registration, sign-up, or account creation. Just visit the page and start using the Base64 encoder/decoder immediately. There are no limits on usage, no premium tiers, and no hidden fees.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the difference between Base64 and Base64URL encoding?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Standard Base64 uses '+' and '/' characters which can cause issues in URLs and filenames since these characters have special meanings in those contexts. Base64URL (RFC 4648) replaces '+' with '-' and '/' with '_' to make it safe for URLs and filenames. This tool uses standard Base64 encoding. Base64URL is commonly used in URLs, JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), and systems where URL-unsafe characters would cause parsing problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I use this tool offline?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! After you load the page for the first time, the tool can work offline because all processing happens in your browser. Your browser may cache the page, allowing you to use it without an internet connection. This is particularly useful when working in environments with restricted internet access or when handling sensitive credentials that you prefer not to process while connected to networks.</p>

            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <p>Base64 encoding uses a 64-character alphabet (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /) to represent binary data. The encoding process reads input data in 3-byte (24-bit) chunks and converts them to 4 Base64 characters. If the input length isn't divisible by 3, padding characters ('=') are added to the end. This tool uses JavaScript's native `btoa()` function for encoding and `atob()` for decoding, with proper UTF-8 handling using `encodeURIComponent()` and `decodeURIComponent()` to support international characters. Standard Base64 produces approximately 33% larger output than input due to the 6-bits-per-character encoding scheme. Browser support is universal across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), and the tool requires only JavaScript to function.</p>
